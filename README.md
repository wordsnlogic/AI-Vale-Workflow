### You’re in a *really* good place now
This README now:
- shows behavior, not promises
- mirrors the terminal exactly
- makes the safety model obvious
- is workshop-, tutorial-, and enterprise-ready

If you want next:
- a **matching tutorial Part 3** that references these exact tables
- a **CI integration appendix**
- or a **“Why we don’t auto-apply AI changes”** explainer for leadership

Just say the word.
